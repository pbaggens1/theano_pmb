Theano is no longer officially maintained. Theano has been forked to Pytensor, 
which continues to be maintained. The Gpuarray backend for Theano was removed, 
and GPU support for Pytensor was moved to Jax.  I personally don't like it 
and I have invested much time and effort into GPU libraries for Theano. 
Therefore, I continued to maintain Theano.  I fixed only what needed to
be fixed so that it works. Perhaps someone with more software experience can
make these changes in a more professional manner.  It still works perfectly
and supports all the newer libraries like Numpy, Python, etc.  

Theano is a great framework, and I hope this will extend its life.

This version of Theano has been tested with the following package versions:

Package              Version            Source
---------            ---------------    ------
gcc                  7.5.0, 7.3.1-5
Python               3.9.16, 3.11.11
Numpy                1.26.4
cuda                 12.2
pygpu                0.7.6
skcuda (scikit-cuda) 0.5.3
libcusolver          11.6.1.9
libcusparse          12.3.1.170
libcublas            12.4.5.8
cuda-compiler        12.4.1            (nvidia)
cuda-libraries       12.4.1            (nvidia)
cudnn                8.9.7.29          conda forge
cuda-tools           12.4.1            (nvidia)
nv-cublas-cu12       12.1.3.1          (pypi)
nv-cuda-nvrtc-cu12   12.1.105


To get things to work with the GPU, there are also some patches to the pycuda, 
pygpu, skcuda (scikit-cuda). The files that I needed to change are also added 
to the main directory in this Git.

Any and all changes that I have made are marked with the capital letters "PMB",
so they can be easily searched. Changes are made to .py as well as .c functions.
This also applies to the few files I have copied from skcuda, pycuda, pygpu.
