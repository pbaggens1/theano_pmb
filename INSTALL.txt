Theano is no longer officially maintained. Theano has been forked to Pytensor, 
which continues to be maintained, but the Gpuarray backend for Theano was removed, 
and GPU support for Pytensor was moved to Jax.  I personally don't like it 
and I have invested much time and effort into GPU libraries for Theano. 
Therefore, I continued to maintain Theano.  I fixed only what needed to
be fixed so that it works. Perhaps someone with more software experience can
make these changes in a more professional manner.  It still works perfectly
and supports all the newer libraries like Numpy, Python, etc.  

Theano is a great framework, and I hope this will extend its life.

This version of Theano has been tested with the following package versions:

Package              Version            Source
---------            ---------------    ------
gcc                  7.5.0, 7.3.1-5
Python               3.9.16, 3.11.11
Numpy                1.26.4
cuda                 12.2
pygpu                0.7.6

cuda-tools           12.4.1            (nvidia)
nv-cublas-cu12       12.1.3.1          (pypi)
nv-cuda-nvrtc-cu12   12.1.105


In addition to the changes to Theano, to get things to work with the GPU, there 
are also some patches to the pycuda, pygpu, skcuda (scikit-cuda). The files that 
were changed are added to the main directory in this Git under the corresponding
directories pycuda, pygpu, skcuda.

Any and all changes that I have made are marked with the capital letters "PMB",
so they can be easily searched. Changes are made to .py as well as .c functions.
This also applies to the few files I have copied from skcuda, pycuda, pygpu.

Installing Theano_PMB with CUDA

1. Install CUDA

To verify, run nvidia-smi.   you should see something like this:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NVIDIA-SMI 535.183.01             Driver Version: 535.183.01   CUDA Version: 12.2     |

|                                         |                      |               MIG M. |

+-----------------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

I believe this will all work for cuda versions 10, 11, 12.
but for 11 and 12, you will nee to set a variable 
in the THEANO_FLAGS environment variable:

gcc.cxxflags=-DCUDAVERSION=11  (or 12)

                                                                                         
2. De-install theano , if you already have it. Then,
   on your computer, install (using conda or pip)

    numpy
    scipy
    pytensor
    matplotlib
    pygpu
    pycuda
    scikit-learn (sklearn)
    scikit-cuda (skcuda)
    cuda-compiler
    cudnn
    nv-cublas-cu12
    (maybe others?)

3. Download Theano_PMB:
     https://github.com/pbaggens1/theano_pmb
To install it, just create a link from the theano_pmb installation directory to your 
python path.  For example:

ln -s /home/paul.baggenstoss/software/Theano_PMB/theano  ~/miniconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/

You should then be able to import theano from python

4.  Set up environment variables for PBN-Toolkit:

export PBNTK_BACKEND=THEANO
export THEANO_FLAGS=mode=FAST_RUN,device=cuda,floatX=float32,magma.library_path=/home/paul.baggenstoss/software/magma-2.5.2/lib,magma.include_path=/home/paul.baggenstoss/software/magma-2.5.2/include,gcc.cxxflags=-DCUDAVERSION=11,cxx=/usr/bin/g++,dnn.include_path=/usr/local/cuda/include,dnn.library_path=/usr/local/cuda/lib64

On some computers, I get the error:
"Mixed dnn version. The header is version 8907 while the library is version 8600."

To fix this, I used:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/paul.baggenstoss/miniconda3/lib/:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
Apparently I have cuda libraries installed twice.  This will select the one installed by conda.

there may also be issues with your system's c-compiler gcc and g++.
It may be necessary to install different versions using devtoolset.

5. Install SMEGMA.

    SMEGMA is a library of custom coded routines in native CUDA for parallel GPU.
    It is called "SMEGMA" because it was originally modified from MAGMA, so is a 
    "cheesy" version of MAGMA #:^).  Because MAGMA was originally imported as a "skcuda" 
    sub-module (import skcuda.magma), this is how smegma is imported, i.e. as 
    "import skcuda.smegma".  Currently, it is completely separate from MAGMA, except 
    for a few header files.
    

a.  unpack the smegma archive. There should be sub-directories including "lib", "src" and "include"
    also install the magma-2.5.2/ directory. That also has sub-directories including "lib", and "include"
    Only the include files from that will be needed.  

b.  In the main directory, there is a script "compile_gpu_cuda12.sh" which should be executed
    to do all the compilation and linking.  You may need to change some paths...
    Note that this assumes you have the cuda compiler "nvcc" as well as the
    libraries libcublas, libcusparse, libcudart, libcudadevrt, libcusolver.

    If all goes well, you should produce the file 

    lib/libsmegma.so

c.  Copy the file libsmegma.so to magma-2.5.2/lib/
    Copy include/smegma*.h to magma-2.5.2/include/

d.  Make sure that the THEANO config variables are set to find
    these include files and libraries:

    magma.library_path=/home/paul.baggenstoss/software/magma-2.5.2/lib
    magma.include_path=/home/paul.baggenstoss/software/magma-2.5.2/include

6. Update scikit-cuda (skcuda), pycuda, pygpu.  This is done simply be overwriting
  the files with the ones in the sub-directories skcuda, pycuda, pygpu.
  There are fixes that are needed to operate with latest Numpy.
  Note that an extra file smegma.py is in skcuda, which allows "import skcuda.smegma"

7.  scan_perform.c

  The c-function scan_perform.c,  located in scan/c_code, is a c-file generated using
  the command:

   $ cython scan_perform.pyx -o c_code/scan_perform.c

  Normally, you don't need to do this. But, if you get compile errors whenever
  you use Theano "scan", then you might need to create scan_perform.c again.
  Note that Python and the gcc and g++ compilers that Theano uses to compile code 
  must be compatible with scan_perform.c and the Python installation.   To be more 
  precise, if you run

  import sys
  print(sys.version)

  this will display the c-compiler used to create your version of Python, and it must be the
  same version from which your "cython" comes.
