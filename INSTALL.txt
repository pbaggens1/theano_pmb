This is a version of Theano that I have modified
from the last official version of Theano, so that it
is compatible with newer versions of Numpy, CUDA, etc.

I am not a software professional,  and have provided
this in the hopes that others find it useful and/or
can help maintain it.

The main difference this has with maintained packages like PyTensor,
is the GPU support. I find the gpuarray backend much better and
hackable than Jax. i I have also created a library of native CUDA
functions that interface to Theano, called "libsmegma".
I call it "smegma" because it is a cheesy version of the MAGMA
library.  I will add this to the repository in the future.

I will also add installation notes as time goes by.

Any and all changes that I have made are marked with the capital letters "PMB",
so they can be easily searched. Changes are made to .py as well as .c functions.

To get things to work with the GPU, there are also some fixes to the 
pycuda, pygpu, skcuda (scikit-cuda) libraries that I will also document.

Send any questions to:   p.m.baggenstoss@ieee.org
